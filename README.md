Very simple plugin for randomizing display names of players on your server. You can also customize the names list and the names of SCPs.

You can always find the latest stable dll [here](https://github.com/steven4547466/HelloMyNameIs/releases/latest). This plugin requires EXILED, which you can find [here](https://github.com/galaxy119/EXILED).

## Config options

- Names - List of names that players can get, default not shown because of how many there are.

### SCP names

- Scp173Name ("Peanut")
- Scp106Name ("Larry")
- Scp049Name ("Doctor")
- Scp0492Name ("Zombie \{name}") - "\{name}" is replaced with a random name.
- Scp079Name ("Computer")
- Scp096Name ("Shyguy")
- Scp939_89Name ("Dog 1")
- Scp939_53Name ("Dog 2")

- CanRepeat (true) - Whether the plugin should repeat names, even if it doesn't need to (it will always repeat if there are no names left).
