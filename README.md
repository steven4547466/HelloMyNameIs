Very simple plugin for randomizing display names of players on your server. You can also customize the names list and the names of SCPs.

## Config options

- Names - List of names that players can get, default not shown because of how many there are.

### SCP names

- Scp173Name ("Peanut")
- Scp106Name ("Larry")
- Scp049Name ("Doctor")
- Scp0492Name ("Zombie \{oldname}") - "\{oldname}" is replaced with their previous nickname, or a random one if they didn't have one.
- Scp079Name ("Computer")
- Scp096Name ("Shyguy")
- Scp939_89Name ("Dog 1")
- Scp939_53Name ("Dog 2")

- CanRepeat (true) - Whether the plugin should repeat names, even if it doesn't need to (it will always repeat if there are no names left).
